**V Balaji - The Upanishads what do they seek?**



**introduction to structure of rig vedas and some other vedas**



-> brief introduction on what he does ( topo geometry and alg geometry ) but his real ambition in life aside from academia is understanding and finding meaning in the vedas and Upanishads





-> first we start with the rig Veda

&nbsp;	-> written by Vyasya

&nbsp;	-> composes of 1057  hymns

&nbsp;	-> the mandalas were written by people who were in awe of the totality of cosmos (spirituality through questions about the self and cosmos)

&nbsp;	-> there are ten Manadalas

&nbsp;	-> they were written in metrical style as measures

&nbsp;	-> "rik" is a is a particle of light etymological speaking

&nbsp;	-> there are 10200 "rik"s in the rig veda which have something to do with measures



-> yajur veda

&nbsp;	-> was kinda like homework given to vyasya's disciple



-> brahmanas(ritualistic?) and aranyakas(meditation) were the learnings of Samhita(in prose form)

&nbsp;	-> Samhita is the oldest section of rig veda (they were of metric form of writing)



-> some important Upanishads :

&nbsp;	1.anitareya (rig)

&nbsp;	2.Kausitaki (rig)

&nbsp;	3.taittinya (yajur)

&nbsp;	4.Brihad - Aranyaka (yajur)

&nbsp;	5.chandogya (sama)

&nbsp;	6.kena (sama)

&nbsp;	7.Katha (naciketas)

&nbsp;	8.svetaskara (?)

&nbsp;	9. (?)

&nbsp;	10. mundaka

&nbsp;	11.maitryani

&nbsp;	12.mandukya

&nbsp;	13.isha (metrical)



-> Upanishads etymology according to V Balaji :
	-> sakalya Samhita

&nbsp;	-> the heart's word or cry, which is the outcome of a divine enthusiasmos 



-> he tells us not to consider him an authority on the subject but just someone explaining what he has understood so far. he further tells us that translation is a mystical process but not a linguistic process as in translation one aims to translate the essence of what a rishi wanted say or convey.



-> rishis believed that the power of the word perpetuates them indefinitely into posterity. They 'live' on through the their words



**what the Upanishads talk about**



-> they spoke about beauty in some senses
	-> "idham shreshtam jyothishyam jyothihi, jyothihi sarvam idam vishvam bhasyate"

&nbsp;	-> This is the highest light among all lights; by this light, the entire universe is illuminated ( mistral small 3)

&nbsp;	-> On Light -> Lo! the supreme light of lights is come, a vaned picturesque awakening consciousness has come to birth (Aurobindo)

&nbsp;	-> On Vision -> a 'Brahman' is an extension of the senses in some sense -> no eye can persieve it completely etc



-> 4 levels of speech (?)

&nbsp;	-> consciousness is some kind of utterance (tf?)
