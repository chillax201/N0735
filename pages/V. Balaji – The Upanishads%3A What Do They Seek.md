- ## Etymology of “Upanishad”
  collapsed:: true
	- * According to V. Balaji (and traditional sources):
	    * "Upanishad" is interpreted as the **heart’s cry or word**
	    * Not just language, but a form of **divine inspiration** (enthousiasmos)
	    * Derived from the root words:
	        * *upa* (near)
	        * *ni* (down)
	        * *sad* (to sit)  
	    * Symbolizes **sitting down near a teacher** to receive spiritual knowledge

	    * He is **not an authority** on the subject
	    * Merely sharing **personal interpretations and insights**
	  * Believes:
	    * Translation is a **mystical act**, not just linguistic
	    * The **essence of what the Rishis intended** must be felt, not just translated
	  * On the power of words:
	    * Rishis believed that their **words are immortal**
	    * The **vibrations of speech** carry their **consciousness forward through time**

- ## Themes in the Upanishads

	    > “This is the supreme light among lights; by this light, the entire universe shines.”
	  * Interpretation:
	    * The light here refers to **Brahman**, the eternal Self that illuminates all
	    * **Perception, awareness, and consciousness** are recurring themes
	    * The **true seer** does not just see with eyes, but through **conscious presence**

	- ## The Four Levels of Speech (Vāc)
	  
	  * Speech is not merely physical utterance but a **multi-layered manifestation of consciousness**.
	  * As per Vedic and Tantric traditions, the **four levels** are:
	- ### 1. **Vaikhari**
	  * The **spoken** form of speech  
	  * Grossest level — what is **audibly heard**  
	  * Related to **Kriyā Shakti** (power of action)  
	  * Linked with the **waking state (jāgrat)**
	- ### 2. **Madhyama**
	  * The **interiorized** mental speech  
	  * What we “say” in our mind before uttering  
	  * Related to **Jñāna Shakti** (power of knowledge)  
	  * Connected with the **dream state (svapna)**
	- ### 3. **Pashyanti**
	  * The **visionary** stage  
	  * Thought exists as **feeling or intention**, not in words  
	  * Related to **Icchā Shakti** (power of will or desire)  
	  * Associated with **deep sleep (sushupti)**
	- ### 4. **Para**
	  * The **purest**, most subtle level  
	  * Beyond articulation — **pure intent or vibration**  
	  * Resides in the **heart or bindu (source point)**  
	  * Connected with **Turiya**, the fourth state of awareness  
	  * This is the level from which **mantras originate**
