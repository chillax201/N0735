- ## Galileo's Relativity principle:
	- experiments done in the hull of two ships ( one at rest and one with constant velocity )
	- he found that he could not find any mechanical experiment that would allow him to differentiate the moving ship from the docked one
	-
- ## Occam's razor
- ## Galileo's principle of equivalence
	- leaning tower of pisa (uniformity of acceleration under gravity)
	- he also discovered time period of a pendulum

- ## Phase Space & Phase portrait
	- NSL in 2$^nd$ order in time 
	  $$m\ddot{\vec{r}} = \vec{f}(\vec{r})$$
	  to solve we need 2 sets of initial data in phase space  :
		- initial position $\vec{r}(0)$
		- initial velocity $\dot{\vec{r}}(0)$
	- Recall : configuration space ($Q$)= set of possible positions
	- state space or phase space ($M$) : set of all instantaneous states of system
		- $$dim(M) = 2dim(Q)$$
	- A trajectory $(x(t),p(t))$ on $M$ is a curve $\rightarrow$ extend as far as possible into past and future
		- it is directed along increasing time
	- a phase portrait of a free particle is a diagram which express multiple trajectories in one diagram
	  conserved quantities help us draw the phase portrait
	- the level set of a conserved quantity is a union of trajectories
-
- moment of refers to left cross multiplying by r
-
- collision or scattering of particles :
	- collision does not mean particles come into contact
	- far past particles are far separated and behave like free particles and also in the far future
	- at intermediate times they are subject to forces of interaction

- ## Hamiltonian
	- Energy in terms of position
