- ## Galileo's Relativity principle:
	- experiments done in the hull of two ships ( one at rest and one with constant velocity )
	- he found that he could not find any mechanical experiment that would allow him to differentiate the moving ship from the docked one
	-
- ## Occam's razor
- ## Galileo's principle of equivalence
	- leaning tower of pisa (uniformity of acceleration under gravity)
	- he also discovered time period of a pendulum

- ## Phase Space & Phase portrait
	- NSL in 2$^nd$ order in time 
	  $$m\ddot{\vec{r}} = \vec{f}(\vec{r})$$
	  to solve we need 2 sets of initial data :
		- initial position $\vec{r}(0)$
		- initial velocity $\dot{\vec{r}}(0)$
