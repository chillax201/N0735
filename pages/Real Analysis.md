- ## Extra Note Points
	- $$P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 \dots$$
		- $P(x)$ is called a power series, that is a an infinite degree polynomial
		- radius of convergence is defined as :
		  $$R = \frac{1}{\lim \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}}$$
		- there are some conditions with the help of which we can deduce whether the power series converges or no depending on radius of convergence
		- ### Thm:
			- Let $R$ be the radius of convergence Let $P(x)$ be as defined above on $(-R,R)$
			- if 
			  $$x_i \rightarrow x_0 \quad \text{all pts in (-R,R)}$$
			  then 
			  $$P(x_i) \rightarrow P(x_0)$$
		- i have no bullfuck idea what happened _lookup_ ___continuity of power series theorem___
		- ### Thm (Rieman) :
			- if $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \dots$ is a series that is conditionally convergent then :
			- you give me  any real number $\alpha$ (or even $=\infty$)
			- Then i can show a permutation $\pi:\left\{1,2, \dots \right\} \rightarrow \left\{1,2, \dots \right\}$
			- such that $a_{\pi(1)} + a_{\pi(2)} + a_{\pi(3)} + \dots = \alpha$
